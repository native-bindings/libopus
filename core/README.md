# @native-bindings/core

This helper classes to parse C/C++ projects to gracefully create bindings for them on Node.js.

## Error handling

The classes in this project can throw JavaScript exceptions. All exceptions are an `Exception` instance. This class has a `what` property that is a string with the error message.

## Preprocessor

Not implemented yet. But it is going to be used to get `#define` directives that are used in libraries like libzip or other C projects like libopus (OPE_OK, OPUS_OK, etc.) to define enums.

## Tokenizer

The `Tokenizer` class is responsible for parsing the C/C++ files and generating a list of `IToken` objects. These objects are used by the `Parser` class.

This class currently also reads the macro directives, but they are totally ignored, and only taken out of the way in a safe way to avoid skipping contents that are not part of the macro definition.

## Parser

Currently the `Parser` class receives an `IToken` list that is generated by the `Tokenizer` class. It will interpret the `typedef enum ...` definitions. These definitions are used to create the constants that are going to be used by the Node.js side that is going to be passing these values to the native code.
